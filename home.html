       <h2>TEFL</h2>
       <h2>TESL</h2>
       <h2>TESOL</h2>
          <h3> Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL), Teaching English as a second language (TESL) or Teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) are terms that refer to teaching English to students whose first language is not English. The terms TESL, TEFL, and TESOL distinguish between the location and student population of a class.[1] TEFL describes English language programs that occur in countries where English is not the primary language. TEFL programs may be taught at a language school or with a tutor. The minimum TEFL requirement is a 100-hour course, however the 120-hour course is strongly recommended because it will help you get hired for the highest-paying teaching position available.[2] TESL and TESOL include English language programs that occur in English-speaking countries. Oftentimes, these classes serve people who have immigrated there (either temporarily for school or work, or permanently) or whose family speaks another language at home. TESOL is a general term that describes TEFL and TESL programs and is a widely accepted term in the field of English language teaching. TEFL teachers may be native or non-native speakers of English. ESL (English as a second language) and TESL (Teaching English as a second language) are outdated terms because they do not include students who speak more than one language prior to their study of English.[3] Students who are learning English in their home country, typically in school, are EFL (English as a foreign language) students.[4] More generally, students learning English are referred to as ELLs (English language learners).</h3>

       <h2>what is teaching </h2>
       <h3>Teaching English as a second language (TESL) refers to teaching English to students whose first language is not English. Usually offered in a region where English is the dominant language and natural English language immersion situations are apt to be plentiful. Usually focused on essential vocabularies, such as family names, household objects, basic adjectives, place names, high-frequency verbs and modal expressions.
        The teaching profession has historically used different names for TEFL and TESL; however, the more generic term teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) is increasingly used to describe the profession. It covers both TESL and TEFL as an umbrella term.[5] Both native speakers and non-native speakers successfully train to be English language teachers. In order to teach English as a Second Language to English Language Learners, or ELLs, one must pass a written and oral test in English to demonstrate proficiency.
       
        The TESOL profession made progress during the 1970s and 1980s in achieving desired goals, such as shifting its focus from product-oriented to process-oriented teaching, specifically referring to an instructor facilitating a learning environment that allows the students to strategize and formulate their ideas such as activities that utilize creativity and exploration rather than strictly learning facts from a rigid curriculum to a more flexible one.
       
        The use of these various terms has led to confusion about the training options for both prospective students and employers. Because there is no global standard for the training of English language teachers, it is important to look beyond the actual acronym/title to the components of the training program. Short term certificate programs that do not have an academic affiliation resulting in credits or degrees (such as CELTA or other non-credit programs) can be a good launching pad for beginning positions internationally, but they will generally not provide sufficient training for a career (unless a person already has substantial experience and a degree in a closely related field). People interested in pursuing a career as an English language teacher should invest in credit-bearing programs that result in a university-recognized certificate or degree program (MA/TESOL, MA/Applied Linguistics) particularly if one wants to work in higher education. Because of the confusing certification situation, employers now generally look for a certificate that reflects at least 100 hours of instruction to determine if the candidate has sufficient preparation to begin teaching English. Institutions with higher standards will require applicants to possess a master's degree for employment.
       
        People wishing to teach in the K-12 public school system in the United States will need a state-teacher certification at a minimum and an ELL Endorsement (or other state qualification) to be qualified to teach ELL.
       
        When choosing a graduate program, it is important to determine if the program is designed to prepare students to teach in K-12 settings OR in adult education settings. Most programs are designed for one or the other, but not both.
       
        In California, teachers may become certified as California Teachers of English Learners (CTEL).</h3>

       <h2>Teaching Techniques</h2>
     </p>
     <article>
      <p>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <h3>Literature reading is vital in learners' literacy development. TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) that uses literature aimed at children and teenagers is rising in popularity. Youth-oriented literature offers simpler material ("simplified readers" are produced by major publishers), and often provides a more conversational style than literature for adults. Children's literature in particular sometimes provides subtle cues to pronunciation, through rhyming and other word play. One method for using these books is the multiple-pass technique. The instructor reads the book, pausing often to explain certain words and concepts. On the second pass, the instructor reads the book completely through without stopping. Textbooks contain a variety of literature like poetry, stories, essays, plays etc. through which certain linguistic items are taught.
          Reading aloud to students who are learning English as a foreign language is a highly effective strategy to assist them in learning the basic rules and understandings of the process of reading. When teachers read aloud to their students, they simply model fluency and comprehension, while also adding visual support, periodic paraphrasing, and extension.[6] When choosing an appropriate text for the student, both the vocabulary and concepts of the text that may be new to the student need to be considered.[6] To make sure they get definite understanding of the text, engaging the students during reading will assist them with making connections between what is being read and the new vocabulary.[6]</h3>

         <h2>Communicative Language Teaching</h2>
         <h3>Communicative language teaching (CLT) emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms,[7] it continues to be popular, particularly in Japan, Taiwan,[8] and Europe. In India, CBSE ( Central Board of Secondary Education) has adopted this approach in its affiliated schools.
          The task-based language learning approach to CLT has gained ground in recent years. Proponents believe CLT is important for developing and improving speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills and that it prevents students from merely listening passively to the teacher without actually interacting. Dogme[9] is a similar communicative approach that encourages teaching without published textbooks, instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.[10]</h3>

         <h2>Blended learning</h2>
         <h3>Blended learning is a combination of multimedia elements (also known as computer-assisted language learning), achieved through a virtual learning environment (VLE) with classroom instruction, a teacher, and peers. Blended learning utilizes technology to provide massive amounts of comprehensible input to its learners through video and other types of multimedia, without a teacher present.
          VLEs have been a major growth point in the English Language Teaching (ELT) industry over the last five years. There are two types:
         
          Externally hosted platforms that a school or institution exports content to (e.g., the proprietary Web Course Tools, or the open source Moodle)
          Content-supplied, course-managed learning platforms (e.g. the Macmillan English Campus)
          The former provides pre-designed structures and tools, while the latter supports course-building by the language school—teachers can blend existing courses with games, activities, listening exercises, and grammar reference units contained online. This supports classroom, self-study or remote practice (for example in an internet café). Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan in India has launched a web portal ECTLT where learners can learn English and other subjects online and interact with their own teachers of KVS across the country.</h3>

         <h2>Online Classroom</h2>
         <h3>Advances in technology have made it possible to get a TEFL qualification online. Students can enroll in online classes that are accredited by organizations such as the British Council or Cambridge ESOL. There is no single overarching accreditation body for TEFL; however, private for-profit companies have been known to invent accreditation affiliates and use them to cheat the customer.[11]
          Study materials are divided into modules that students are tested on. Support is handled by tutors, who can be reached via email. After successfully finishing the last module, the student is granted a certificate that comes in digital form or can be shipped to the student's address. Getting such a certificate can be beneficial as many employers require a TEFL certificate.</h3>
